"You cannot condemn my actions, how many did you kill after you promised peace?"
"{v:killcount}, i remember every single one of them"
different dialogs for 0 kills and for all kills

Passionate and Sensible, dislikes violence but still fights.
Mostly introspective, and somewhat elusive.
is quick witted and intelligent, often offering tactical plans on the go.


Comes from a long line of Airdancers(from master to student, not blood related since air nomad)
Worked as a Strider, the nomad scouts and explorers, they go to uncharted places. they are trained to use a bow, mainly as a way to fight wayward spirits(this is not particularly lethal to them, but bending hurts them bad) 

## Bramar
Stoic and direct, cares little about anything but will try to do whats right.
He is a man of few words but sometimes throws funny comments
Both strong and reliable, and really affectionate when you get to know him
Prefers fair solutions

Worked as a cobbler until the attack, is younger than he looks


## Anael
Observant and graceful.
Calm, empathetic and deeply involved in other's wellbeing. Functions as the emotional anchor for the group.

Tries to act like a parent figure, even if both Nelad and Folre are older than her.
Believes that all life should be protected, even the enemy, but when one tries to harm another that "breaks the balance" as she says.
Has 0 clue about anything spirit related, that role falls to Nelad. but she is knowladgeable of current events and politics, somehow

## Folre
Twitchy, like, really twitchy, cannot stay still. 
he is full of energy and barely stops doing stuff.
headstrong and impulsive, but will defer to the leader's decisions after a life of indoctrination in the army

has little attachment to his family, but has a deep desire to grow strong(fire propaganda at its finest).
Has an actual sense of justice, even if it is somewhat skewed
sword junkie. 
self exiled after taking the eye of the prince, ran away to escape execution. the prince doesnt really mind, but he insists their next duel will be to the death.
prince:"You technically defeated me you see, and my pride demands a rematch, and since the last one made the loser get maimed, this one naturally is to the death"




## If they had Awakening style crit quotes
Another broken covenant
may your spirit find peace in the afterlife
You are all they sent?
This is what i live for!

Mute airbender, adopted into the royal family and serving as Zoran's right hand.
She has a bell that uses to make sound, she airbends(this looks like hand signs, but no one in game knows what those are) the bell to produce a high pitched and robotic voice. feels eerie since she does not move her lips to talk. handy with knives

The Fire nation Prince in charge of the local campaign, Aloof and carefree, but will kill pretty much everyone in his path, with no regard for human life unless it has value to him specifically. complete sociopath/psycopath(dont know which, but think of Ozai)




Killer weapons are renamed as meteoric weapons(SPACE SWORD). needs specialized facilities to make one.


# Chapter 1 will be in a raided village, kill boss
Nelad gets there while the raiders are finishing, but there is still a survivor.
Bramar has been fighting all day in his home, is recruitable.(might add a force recruit if he was not found in chapter)
Juro was sent to both raid frontier villages for loot, and to kill all benders they find. he wants a promotion
there is a hidden spirit(mogall) in the top right corner, behind the boss.

# Chapter 2 will be in a flooded town, escape
Anael is recruited in the intro
the goal is to get to the temple(escape) to stop the fire nations plans. the temple hosts a group of sacred spirit relics(all C rank magic weapons) both powerful and unbreakable.
The temple was sunk by the waterbenders,
Adriana is seen at the intro, but soon goes into the temple and leaves the minions to fight the party.

The Armory gives a steel weapon based on who enters(bow/axe/lance)

The Vendor gives an accesory based on who enters
Its the same as the ones they start with(so now you can have one duplicate)

standing in the water reduces fire damage taken

allies are a couple waterbenders(monk?) and a single militia(recruit)[need some sort of reward based on how many remain alive at the end]
enemies range from firebenders(mage), , 


the boss is Ol(Royal Guard)	steel sword/ fire E fire C	roam AI, is looking for a missing royal guard and asks the party if they saw one, after a short talk, he concludes that while they were most helpful in answering, they remain enemies of the crown, and must be eliminated. Bramar comments that the guy is too polite to be angry at, but he agrees that they must fight.
 miniboss Null(Warrior)	Killer axe/ killer bow	pursue AI, constantly yells and has a lot of dialogue for each turn that passes. will say GET BENT sometime, dont know when




Folre is recruited in the outro, he jumps the party from the temple roof attacking them, but misses. when the party tries to retaliate he apologizes and says he was expecting someone else(while this is true, he went for the kill the moment he saw someone wearing nomad's colors, he was part of the party that assaulted the northern temple and he became extremely paranoid after fighting airbenders.)
after a small talk the party decides to trust him, for now.



## some dialogue
	A"We tried sunking the temple when we saw them coming, for the only things of value lie there"
	N"Could it be an earthbender? We saw a kingdom citizen outside, the crazy guy yelling at us"
	B"Not possible, I can't bend this at all, it's not stone"
	A"The temple was a gift from our sibling tribe, the swamp shamans. It is made from a special kind of wood, that does not rot nor float. The walls are hollow and filled with water, so only a waterbender can move it.




	A" Adriana! How could you?!"
	F"Who's the water lady? I just joined so I'm a bit lost"
	N"..."
	B"No clue, just met the other water lady today, we are as lost as you buddy"




# Chapter 3 will be inside the sunken temple, rout
Adriana(Ari's unit) went there to steal all spirit relics found within, to give to the fire army, in exchange for a high rank in the military.
there are thieves, skirmishers? and a couple water / fire benders inside

the map contains a couple chests(no key needed) and a lot of walls and botomless pits,(folre can jump them, funnily enough, he is the only one that has access to all areas)

The party is given a couple magic weapons, courtesy of Anael.
You can get only 2 magic weapons, in a choice menu. 

in the outro foldre mentions how cool the sword is, and that it reminds him of the meteoric weapons they are making. when questioned he says the army built a new forge to create them, they are way better than steel ones. the party agrees that they should stop them. Foldre guides them.


# Chapter 4 is in the forest going to the next area
Boss is a haunted spirit tree, that summons eyes?, there is couple spirits wandering. this map has a crapton of accesories as loot
Sakura appears as an ally for this map




# Chapter 5 will be in a volcano, seize
both Forge(Nut's unit) and ***(Jake's unit) are the bosses, one on each side of the map
they keep bombarding the players with long range magic

the goal is to get to the top, and destroy(seize) the lava forge the fire nation built there, it will stop their meteoric weapon supply


# Chapter 6 
tbd
will end with them reching the prince's castle


# Chapter 7	Fire nation Castle,	 kill boss
Prince Zoran is waiting patiently for the challengers to come
Zoran's left hand is a mute airbender...
Defeat boss, standard map.
This is the last step, whoever dies stays down for good.
